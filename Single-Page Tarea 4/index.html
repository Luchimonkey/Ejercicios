						<h3>SPORTSMANSHIP</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>The common interest that members of the Association share is to inspire
								youth to practice the ideals of sportsmanship and fair play. Any player,
								coach, team, parent, spectator, administrator or referee whose behavior
								detracts from this purpose is subject to disciplinary action regardless of
							technical soccer background, expertise, accomplishments or standing.</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h3>FIFA FIELD REGULATIONS</h3>
						<ol>
							<li><strong>DIMENSIONS.</strong> FIFA Law 1 provides for flexible external field dimensions
								within a given maximum and minimum width and length. These
								dimensions should be adhered to for all fields used by teams under 12
							and older.</li>
							<li class="subreglas"><strong>COMPETITION FIELDS.</strong> Fields used within the competition program must
								be a minimum of 100 x 60 yards. Leagues, districts or associations
								participating in the state competition program that are unable to provide a
								field that meets these minimum requirements must advise the State
								Competition Board which will assign its Fields Committee to inspect the
								field and recommend to the Board whether or not a waiver of the minimum
								dimensions should be granted. Teams from leagues, districts or
								associations that are unable to provide an acceptable field may be
							required to play all their games away.</li>
							<li class="subreglas">
								<strong>FIELDS USED BY YOUNG AGE GROUPS.</strong>
								<ol class="listaletra">
									<li>U-6 play on a field approximately 20 X 40 yards with no penalty
									areas. Fields for older age groups should be progressively larger. </li>
									<li>U-8 plays on a field 40-50 yards in length and 20-30 yards width.</li>
									<li>U-10 play on a field 70-80 yards in length and 40-50 yards in width. </li>
									<li>In addition, fields used by young age groups may have their internal
									dimensions and size of goal similarly modified.</li>
								</ol>
							</li>
							<li class="subreglas">
								<strong>TEAM BENCH AREAS</strong>
								<ol class="listaletra">
									<li>Recreation & District Programs
										<ul>
											<li>The decision for team/spectator placement on the field will
												be made by the governing body of that team. A team’s
												bench area shall consist of that area at least one (1) yard
												away from the touchline and extending to twenty yards (20)
												both ways from the halfway line. In the event that field 
												2
												conditions require team benches to be on the same side of
												the field, a team’s bench area shall consist of that area two
												(2) yards away from the touchline and extending twenty
											yards one (1) way from the halfway line.</li>
											<li>The home team has first choice as to where it wishes to
												locate its bench area. Coaches and substitutes are required
												to rediv id
												within their bench area during the game. Parents
												and spectators should occupy the same side of the field as
											the team they are supporting.</li>
										</ul>
									</li>
									<li>State Competition League Only
										<ul>
											<li>Except where it is determined by the referee to be
												impractical, team bench areas shall be along the same
												touchline. Each team bench area shall be located two yards
												outside the touchline, beginning not closer than five yards
												from midfield and extending not further than twenty yards
												from midfield. The home team shall have the right to choose
												the location of its bench area. Coaches and substitutes must
												rediv id
											within their team's bench area during the game.</li>
											<li>Parents and spectators must occupy the sideline opposite
												the team bench areas. Supporters of a team must assemble
												on the side of the midfield facing the team bench area of that
												team. There shall be a buffer zone extending ten yards on
												each side of the midfield that may not be occupied by
												parents or spectators. Match officials shall be empowered to
												enforce these provisions and may suspend or terminate
												games in the event that any team, coach, parent, or
												spectator declines to abide by requests from match officials
											to comply with these standards.</li>
										</ul>
									</li>
								</ol>
							</li>
						</ol>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h3>EQUIPMENT</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>We will abide by and accept equipment standards as defined by FIFA,
							USSF and USYSA.</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
					<div>

						<ul>

								start a sanctioned game. No more than eleven (11) players per team may
							be on the field at any one time during the game.</li>
							<li><strong>SIZE OF AGE GROUP TEAMS.</strong> In order to give player’s maximum
								opportunity to develop in the game of soccer, U-6 through U-1O play
								modified rules and size of roster as stated in United States Youth Soccer
								Association (USYSA) rules. It is strongly recommended that U-6 and U-8
								play 4 v 4. UYSA shall not sanction games involving teams under 10 or
								younger unless such games are conducted with not more than eight (8)
							players per side. (National rule 4036 section 2)</li>
							<li>Recreational/Developmental players at other ages or where numbers in
								the playing area are low are strongly encouraged to play small-sided
							games on reduced field size.</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h3>SUBSTITUTIONS</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Teams may make an unlimited number of substitutions at the times
								indicated below. A player who has been replaced may re-enter the game
								as a substitute at a later time.
								<ol>
									<li>Prior to a throw-in your favor.</li>
									<li>Prior to a goalkick by either team.</li>
									<li>After a goal by either team.</li>
									<li>After an injury, by either team, when the referee stops play.</li>

						</ul>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h3>CONFISCATED PLAYER PASSES</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Passes of any individual(s) ejected from any match shall be retained after
								the match by the referee. The pass of any individual who has received a
								third caution (yellow card) during a playing year shall be confiscated by
								the referee at the conclusion of the match in which the third caution was
								received. That player will be suspended from playing in the next game in
								which the offending participant would otherwise be eligible to participate.
								This process will continue so that for every third yellow card received
								during a playing year, the player will be suspended from playing in the
								next game (after the receipt of a third yellow card) for which the offending
								participate would otherwise be eligible to participate. The referee shall
								deliver all confiscated passes to the UYSA State Office within forty-eight
							(48) hours of the conclusion of the match.</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h3>ALL-PLAY</h3>

							<li>All-play means that every recreation player on every team shall play at
								least fifty percent of each game. Coaches in the competition program are
								encouraged to play their players 50% of each game.
								<ul class="listapblanco">

										under special circumstances, e.g., unexcused absences from
										practice and/or games, ungentlemanly conduct at practice and/or
									games, and injuries.</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
					<div>

						</ul>
					</div>
					<div>

								points of strategy and position, is permitted provided that:
								<ol>
									<li>No mechanical, electrical or other devices are used to amplify the
									voice.</li>

					</div>
					<div>

						<ul>
							<li>Any game terminated after 15 minutes into the second half by the referee
								by reason of the elements, or by reason of grave disorder on the part of
								the coaches, players or spectators of a team that is losing at the point that
								the game is terminated, shall stand as a completed game. If a team is
								ahead and the game is called because of their actions they will lose the
							game 1-0.</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h3>CONDITIONS OF REPLAY OF GAMES</h3>

							Committee</li>
